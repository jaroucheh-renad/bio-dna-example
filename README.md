# DNA Analysis Script

## Aim
I created this script using the Biopython library to perform basic DNA sequence analysis and visualization. It is designed for anyone interested in learning more about the use of computing in biology, allowing users to experiment with analyzing DNA sequences. This script can process DNA sequences to visualize genetic data.

## Key Features
- Basic DNA sequence parsing and manipulation.
- Visualization of nucleotide distributions and sequence composition.
- Introduction to computational biology using Python and Biopython.

## What you should already have
- Python (I use version: 3.11)
- Biopython library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jaroucheh-renad/bio-dna-example.git
   cd bio-dna-example
   ```

2. Install required packages:
  ```
  pip install biopython
  ```
3. Running the script
   ```
   python test.py
   ```
